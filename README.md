# Text to Speak

Hello! Welcome to my Text To Speech (TTS) app. Built using Tauri as the framework to convert this web application into a desktop application.

Currently, the app is only able to access voices that come default with your OS, as a result it is not able to access any voices when run in a linux system. However it should work fine in Windows!
